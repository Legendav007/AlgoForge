# AlgoForge

Welcome to **AlgoForge**!  
AlgoForge is a mentored open-source repository created as part of the **Winter of Open Source** initiative by our college coding club. It focuses on building a high-quality, well-structured collection of **algorithms and data structures** through community contributions.

This repository is designed to help contributors strengthen problem-solving skills, write clean and maintainable code, and gain real-world experience with open-source collaboration.
