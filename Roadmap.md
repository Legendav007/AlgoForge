# AlgoForge Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned and completed algorithms for the **AlgoForge** repository.  
It helps contributors identify what has already been implemented and what is still needed.

Please check this file before starting a contribution to avoid duplication.

If you feel any algorithm is missing and need to be add you can put it here.
