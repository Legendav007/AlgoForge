# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to **AlgoForge**!  
AlgoForge is a mentored open-source repository created as part of the **Winter of Open Source** initiative. The goal of this project is to build a high-quality collection of frequently used **algorithms and data structures** while helping contributors learn clean coding practices and open-source collaboration.

We encourage contributions from all skill levels.

## How to Contribute to AlgoForge

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Legendav007/AlgoForge.git
```

---

### Step 2: Choose an Algorithm

1. Browse the existing folders and check whether the algorithm you want to add already exists.
2. If it exists, do **not duplicate** it. You may improve documentation or add missing explanations.
3. If it does not exist, create a new folder under the appropriate category.
4. Create an **Issue** describing the algorithm you want to work on and wait until it is assigned.

---

## Contribution Format (Mandatory)

⚠️ **Each algorithm must be contributed as a single Markdown (`.md`) file.**

- No standalone `.cpp`, `.java`, or `.py` files  
- Explanation, analysis, and code must all be inside **one `.md` file**  
- Pull Requests not following this format will **not be merged**

---

## Mandatory `algorithm_name.md` Structure

**All algorithm submissions must follow the structure defined in `algorithm_template.md`.**

Each algorithm Markdown file must include the following sections:

- **Algorithm Name**
- **Problem Statement**
- **Approach / Intuition**
- **Step-by-Step Explanation**
- **Code Implementation**
- **Time Complexity**
- **Space Complexity**

---

### Step 3: Update Roadmap.md

After your Pull Request is merged:

- Check the corresponding algorithm in **Roadmap.md**
- If the algorithm is not listed, add a new checkbox under the appropriate section
- Add a **hyperlink** pointing to your algorithm folder or `.md` file

> Do not update the roadmap before your PR is merged.

---

### Step 4: Submit a Pull Request

1. Push your changes to your forked repository
2. Open a Pull Request to the `main` branch

Ensure that:
- The algorithm is documented in a **single `.md` file**
- All mandatory sections are present
- Folder naming follows repository conventions
- Roadmap is updated correctly

Mentors will review your PR and may request changes before merging.

## Important Notes

- ❌ PRs without explanation or analysis will be rejected  
- ❌ PRs containing only raw code will be rejected  
- ❌ PRs not following the `.md` format will be rejected  
- Write clean, readable code  
- Be respectful and open to feedback

Thank you for contributing to **AlgoForge**.  
Learn the algorithm. Explain it. Analyze it. Then code it.
